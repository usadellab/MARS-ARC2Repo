# **MARS-ARC2Repo**

**MARS-ARC2Repo** is a comprehensive implementation of the **Multi-omics Adapter for Repository Submissions (MARS)** within the IBG-4 context. This tool streamlines the submission of multi-omics life sciences data to multiple specialized repositories, bridging the gap between data creation and repository submission, while ensuring that annotated research context is preserved and efficiently transferred.

## **Overview**

The primary goal of MARS-ARC2Repo is to simplify and automate the submission process for complex multi-omics datasets, making it easier for researchers to deposit their annotated research context (ARC) into target repositories. This tool is designed to work seamlessly with MARS, a well-established data brokering platform that enables the submission of life sciences studies across various repositories in a unified and standardized way.

By integrating ARC2Repo, the submission of ARC files is now more intuitive and automated, allowing for better data management and ensuring that datasets are submitted with proper metadata, making them easier to discover, access, and reuse.

## **MARS**

[MARS](https://github.com/elixir-europe/MARS) (Multi-omics Adapter for Repository Submissions) is an ELIXIR Europe initiative aimed at facilitating the submission of life sciences studies, particularly those involving multi-omics datasets, to a variety of specialized data repositories. It acts as a bridge between researchers and repositories, providing a streamlined process for managing and depositing data in a way that complies with repository standards.

MARS is highly adaptable and supports a wide range of repositories, ensuring that multi-omics data can be stored in the appropriate domain-specific locations. It provides a standardized way to prepare and submit data, reducing the complexity that typically accompanies such processes.

## **ARC2Repo**

**ARC2Repo** is a specialized tool that focuses on submitting Annotated Research Context (ARC) files to repositories. ARC files contain vital metadata and annotations that describe the research context of a study, ensuring that the data are well-documented and understandable to future users. ARC2Repo enables researchers to package their ARC files and submit them efficiently, ensuring that repositories receive complete and well-structured datasets.

The tool automates the preparation and submission process, reducing manual errors and ensuring that ARC submissions meet the stringent requirements of target repositories. By using ARC2Repo, researchers can be confident that their annotated data is submitted in compliance with repository standards, enhancing the overall quality and discoverability of their research.

## **Features**

- **Multi-Repository Support**: Integrates with multiple repositories, enabling seamless submission of multi-omics datasets across various platforms.
- **Automation**: Automates the submission of ARC files, reducing the time and effort needed to prepare datasets for deposition.
- **Metadata Integrity**: Ensures that all required metadata is included with the dataset, providing detailed contextual information that enhances data reuse.
- **Compliance**: Supports compliance with repository-specific submission formats and requirements.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle both small and large-scale datasets, making it suitable for a wide range of research projects.
